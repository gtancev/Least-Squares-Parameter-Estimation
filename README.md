# Least-Squares-Parameter-Estimation
Estimate the kinetic constant of a first order reaction in a cascade of two continuous stirred tank reactors.

A first order reaction with a unknown kinetic constant is given. After reactor 1, the concentration is measured at several time points.
With OLS, this is estimated by fitting the model to the data.
